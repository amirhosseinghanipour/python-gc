# Python Garbage Collector in Rust ü¶Ä

> *Because who needs Python's reference counting when you can have RAII, zero-cost abstractions, and fearless concurrency?*

This is an attempt on Python's three-generation garbage collection model, written in pure Rust with all the memory safety guarantees you'd expect from a proper systems language.

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for Python garbage collection in Rust. Planned improvements include:
- Lock-free data structures
- Memory pool
- JIT compilation
- NUMA-Aware allocation

Performance optimization will focus on reducing collection overhead and improving memory locality. The modular design allows for incremental improvements without affecting the core architecture or C API compatibility.
